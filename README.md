# Financial Transaction Analysis for Fraud Detection

This C++ project analyzes financial transaction data from a CSV file to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and lay the foundation for fraud detection.

The project involves:

- Parsing and analyzing a transaction data CSV file
- Implementing core data structures and algorithms:
  - Custom Array
  - Linked List
  - Grouping by Payment Channels
  - Sorting and Searching algorithms for both array and linked list
- Output results to a JSON file
